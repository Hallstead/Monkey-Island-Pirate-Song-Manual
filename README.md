# Monkey-Island-Pirate-Song-Manual
Archipelago Manual for the MMonkey Island Pirate Song 

This manual is intended for used with a video of the song, or tlrather the OST found at
https://youtu.be/2SFZI5dgmAI?si=Zfi6MMbzKgXW41jd

It begins by you listening to the intro, then you start with Guybrush's lyric for the first verse. Then as more Lyrics come in, you jump to the part of the video with that lyric/verse.

This could theoretalso be done with the song running in the game itself, as there is a setting to ensure that the final verse/outro is the last one sung by requirement as this ends the song in the game.


the goal is to sing the whole song. Enjoy being the pirate you were meant to be!
